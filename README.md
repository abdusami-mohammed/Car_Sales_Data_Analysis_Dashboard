## Project Workflow
**Data Cleaning, Modeling, and Processing**
The raw data was cleaned, processed, and structured for effective analysis. A Calendar Table was created to support time-based analysis, including all dates from the minimum to maximum date in the data.

**KPI Development**
Multiple key metrics were defined to provide insights on performance, growth, and sales patterns, including Year-to-Date (YTD), Month-to-Date (MTD), and Year-over-Year (YoY) calculations.

**Visualizations**
The dashboard includes an Overview and a Details view, accessible via a toggle button. Green and red color indicators are used across visuals to signal positive and negative changes.
